## Data analysis


# Results

## Psychometric properties of the two CAT-CDIs

Our first aim was to examine whether CAT-CDIs in American English and Polish demonstrate comparable psychometric properties. To that end, we revisit the psychometric properties reported for the American English CAT-CDI (word production) in Kachergis et al. (2022) and compare those to the data from Polish CAT-CDI (Words and Sentences).

<!-- AmE r values copied from Kachergis et al. 2022 -->
```{r}
cor(by_child_pl$cat_theta, by_child_pl$score_full) # AmE:.86, PL: 0.86
cor(by_child_pl$cat_theta, by_child_pl$full_theta) # AmE: .92, PL: .92
cor(by_child_pl$full_theta, by_child_pl$score_full) # AmE: .95, PL: 0.94
```

We found similarly strong correlations in the two languages between the abilities estimated from CDI-CAT and full CDI scores (American English and Polish: $r$ = .86), the abilities estimated from the CDI-CAT and abilities estimated from full CDI (American English and Polish: $r$ = .92), and the abilities estimated from the full CDI and the full CDI scores (American English: $r$ = .95, Polish: $r$ = `r cor(by_child_pl$full_theta, by_child_pl$score_full)`). The abilities estimated from the CDI-CAT and the full CDI scores were also strongly correlated within individual age groups (see Table \@ref(tab:corr-by-age)).


```{r corr-by-age, include = T}
# Correlations by age
# to-do: merge both tables?
# English
valid_tab <- prod_s %>% 
  mutate(age_group = cut(age_full, breaks=seq(12,36,3), right=F, include.lowest = T)) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(r = cor(fullTheta, catTheta), n=n()) #%>% kableExtra::kable(digits=2)

valid_tab_wide = rbind(round(valid_tab$r, 2), as.character(valid_tab$n))
colnames(valid_tab_wide) = as.character(valid_tab$age_group)
row.names(valid_tab_wide) = c('r ability CAT vs full CDI', 'N')

apa_table(valid_tab_wide, caption="American English: Correlations between ability estimated by CAT-CDI and ability estimated from full CDI by children's age") 

# Polish
age_cor_table <- by_child_pl %>% 
  mutate(age_group = cut(age_CAT, breaks=seq(12,36,3), right=F, include.lowest = T)) %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(r = cor(full_theta, cat_theta), n=n())

age_cor_table_wide = rbind(round(age_cor_table$r, 2), as.character(age_cor_table$n))
colnames(age_cor_table_wide) = as.character(age_cor_table$age_group)
row.names(age_cor_table_wide) = c('r ability CAT vs full CDI', 'N')

apa_table(age_cor_table_wide, caption = "Polish: Correlations between ability estimated by CAT-CDI and ability estimated from full CDI by children's age")
```


The Polish validation study included `r sum(by_child_pl$lang_group == "multilingual")` data from bi- and multilingual families. Though it is a small group, we decided to explore their correlation coefficients (non-parametric Spearman's rho) and found these were similar to those found for Polish monolingual children (see Table X in Supplementary Materials). <!-- TO DO -->

```{r, include = T}

cor1 <- by_child_pl %>%
  group_by(lang_group) %>%
  summarise(r = cor(cat_theta, score_full, method = "spearman"), n = n()) %>%
  mutate(correlation = "Ability from CDI-CAT ~ full CDI score")

cor2 <- by_child_pl %>%
  group_by(lang_group) %>%
  summarise(r = cor(cat_theta, full_theta, method = "spearman"), n = n()) %>%
  mutate(correlation = "Ability from CDI-CAT ~ ability from full CDI")

cor3 <- by_child_pl %>%
  group_by(lang_group) %>%
  summarise(r = cor(full_theta, score_full, method = "spearman"), n = n()) %>%
  mutate(correlation = "Ability from full CDI ~ full CDI score")

lang_cor_table <- bind_rows(cor1, cor2, cor3)
rm(cor1, cor2, cor3)

apa_table(lang_cor_table, caption = "Supplementary Material: Table S1 - Spearman's correlations for monolingual and multilingual children in the Polish dataset")
